# Waiting Queue Simulator README

## Application description

qsim simulates the arrival and servicing of 100 customers. The customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean arrival rate of lamba per hour.
The number os servers can be varied.
The service time for each customer is normally distibuted with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
The application allows varying these input parameters to see the impact on average waiting time, server utilization and queue length at any point in time.
